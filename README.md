# Mob Talismans
NeoForge mod that adds QoL accessories (curios) that provide utilities against annoying mobs, as well as some other fun gadgets.

**Requires [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories/versions?l=neoforge)**

<br>

Aims to:
- provide useful utilities against annoying mobs
- enhance gameplay without becoming overpowered or trivializing mob interactions
- occupy rarely used accessory slots with useful QoL gadgets
- be modpack friendly (many config options, progression may be gated via kubejs)

## Idea:
- [P1] Accessories that are somewhat expensive to make that make mobs less annoying or offer other utilities tied to mobs
    - [x] [P1] Durability that is slowly used up, only while activated
    - [ ] [P1] Talismans:
        - [x] [P1] **Conduit Necklace**: hurts aggressive aquatic mobs in the vicinity
        - [x] [P1] **Creeper Belt**: prevents nearby creepers from doing block damage
        - [ ] [P1] **Enderman Anklet**: prohibits nearby endermen from picking up blocks
        - [x] [P1] **Silverfish Ring**: converts infested blocks nearby to their non-infested variant
        - [x] [P1] **Phantom Cloak**: deters phantoms, just like cats do
    - [ ] [P2] More Talismans:
        - [ ] [P2] **Vex Ring**: makes vex despawn faster (or smaller radius around their summoning evoker)
        - [ ] [P2] **Wandering Trader Charm**: prevents wandering traders from spawning in a big radius
        - [ ] [P2] **Batwing Glasses**: prevents bats from spawning nearby
        
    - [ ] [P2] Configurable whether they recharge or need to be repaired
- [ ] [P3] Placeable Charms:
    - **Evoker**: used on beds & respawn anchors to make them a single-use fallback spawnpoint
        - Any other bed can be used as a temporary spawnpoint, but if they're broken, the player will respawn at their fallback bed/anchor
        - Chat message when the charmed bed/anchor is used or broken to inform the player
