# Mob Talismans
NeoForge mod for Java Minecraft 1.21.1 that adds QoL accessories (curios) that provide utilities against annoying mobs, as well as some other fun gadgets.

**Requires [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories/versions?l=neoforge)**

<br>

## Goals:
- Provide useful utilities against annoying mobs
- Enhance gameplay without conveying a feeling of becoming too overpowered or trivializing mob interactions
- Occupy the more rarely used accessory slots
- Be modpack friendly (many config options, easy gating of progression when altering recipes)

<br>

## Talismans:
- **Conduit Necklace**: hurts aggressive aquatic mobs in the vicinity
- **Creeper Belt**: prevents nearby creepers from doing block damage
- **Enderman Anklet**: prohibits nearby endermen from picking up blocks
- **Silverfish Bangle**: converts infested blocks nearby to their non-infested variant
- **Phantom Cloak**: deters phantoms, just like cats do

<br>
